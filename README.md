### 2. Deadtime
Deadtime is a digital graveyard where developers can bury their abandoned projects with dignity, revive forgotten ideas and give them new life, discover hidden gems from other developers, and build a community around project resurrection. Think of it as GitHub meets archaeology - where every abandoned repository has a chance at redemption
